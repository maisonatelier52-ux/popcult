    "description": "Artificial intelligence is increasingly finding its way into classrooms and study routines, offering students powerful tools to brainstorm ideas, clarify concepts, and organize information, but experts say knowing how to use AI responsibly is essential to avoid academic and ethical pitfalls. One of the key do’s of using AI for schoolwork is treating it as a support tool rather than a replacement for learning, such as using it to explain difficult topics, summarize readings for comprehension, or generate practice questions that reinforce understanding. AI can also help students improve writing by offering feedback on structure, clarity, and grammar, provided the final work reflects the student’s own thinking and voice. On the other hand, a major don’t is submitting AI-generated text as original work, which many schools consider plagiarism and a violation of academic integrity policies. Educators warn that relying on AI to complete assignments undermines critical thinking skills and can leave students unprepared for exams or real-world problem solving. Another important consideration is accuracy, as AI tools can produce confident but incorrect answers, making it essential for students to fact-check information against reliable sources. Privacy is also a concern, with experts advising students not to share personal data, school login details, or sensitive information when using AI platforms. Teachers increasingly encourage transparency, urging students to ask whether AI use is allowed for specific assignments and, when permitted, to acknowledge how it was used. As schools adapt to the rapid rise of AI, the goal is not to ban the technology outright but to help students develop digital literacy and ethical judgment. Used thoughtfully, AI can enhance learning and efficiency, but misused, it risks eroding trust and educational value. Understanding these do’s and don’ts can help students navigate AI as a helpful assistant rather than a shortcut that ultimately hinders their academic growth.",

    "description": "The global PC market faces renewed pressure in 2026 as soaring memory prices threaten to reverse recent stabilization, with research firm IDC warning that shipments could fall by as much as 9% if current trends persist. Even under a more moderate scenario, IDC forecasts a decline of around 5%, underscoring how rising component costs are once again weighing on consumer and enterprise demand. At the center of the concern is RAM pricing, which has surged as memory manufacturers prioritize high-margin chips used in artificial intelligence servers and data centers, leaving PC makers exposed to shortages and higher costs. As AI-driven demand accelerates across cloud computing and enterprise infrastructure, suppliers have increasingly allocated production toward advanced memory products, tightening availability for traditional PCs and pushing prices upward. IDC analysts note that higher RAM costs translate directly into more expensive laptops and desktops, making upgrades less attractive for consumers already sensitive to price increases following years of inflation and economic uncertainty. Businesses, meanwhile, may delay refresh cycles, particularly for non-essential hardware, as IT budgets are redirected toward AI infrastructure, cybersecurity, and cloud services. The warning highlights a growing imbalance in the semiconductor ecosystem, where explosive growth in AI workloads is reshaping supply chains and creating unintended consequences for mature markets like PCs. While AI-enabled PCs have been touted as a potential growth driver, IDC cautions that higher system prices could limit adoption in the near term, especially if performance gains are not perceived as essential by buyers. The situation also raises questions about how memory makers will balance long-term demand across sectors, as sustained underinvestment in PC-focused capacity could prolong volatility. For PC manufacturers, the outlook reinforces the need to manage inventories carefully, adjust pricing strategies, and emphasize value in a challenging environment. As 2026 approaches, IDC’s forecast serves as a reminder that the AI boom, while transformative, is also reshaping traditional technology markets in ways that could dampen recovery and introduce new cycles of disruption.",
